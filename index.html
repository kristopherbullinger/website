      <p>Hello. My name is Kristopher Bullinger. I am a software developer new to the industry, looking to make big changes. I have half a year's experience with Ruby and Javascript, and beginner level experience with HTML and CSS. I want to use these skills (and more that I will acquire on the way) to bring some good to the world, in whatever way I can. </p>
      <p>I have a Bachelor's of Science in Chemical Engineering from Clarkson University. I graduated in 2015, and went on to work in manufacturing sciences at a large, well-known pharmaceutical company in the manufacturing department. For various reasons, I came to realize that this field of study was not something that I wanted to do. After being introduced to the world of computer programming by a close friend, I decided that the fasat-paced, constantly-changing technology industry was the one for me.</p>
