      <p>Hello. My name is Kristopher Bullinger. I am a software developer new to the industry, currently residing in Queens, New York. I have almost a year's experience with Ruby, Rails, Javascript, React, as well as HTML and CSS. I want to use these skills (and more that I will acquire on the way) to bring some good to the world, in whatever way I can. </p>
      <p>I have a Bachelor's of Science in Chemical Engineering from Clarkson University. I graduated in 2015, and went on to work in manufacturing sciences at a large, well-known pharmaceutical company in the manufacturing department. For various reasons, I came to realize that this field of study was not something that I wanted to do. After being introduced to the world of computer programming by a close friend, I decided that the fast-paced, constantly-changing technology industry was the one for me. This realization led me to apply to one of NYC's finest web development bootcamps, where I quickly picked up a wide range of skills which have empowered me to be able to create modern, dynamic web apps.</p>
      <p>My aim is to excel as a software or web developer by always learning new skills and tricks to make my work easier to perform and to roll out more effective projects. Spending a little bit of time each day to learning and improving oneself professionally and otherwise is critical to long-term success. Professionally speaking, this means cultivating curiosity about my work, participating in projects which require the use of new technologies, and engaging with a community of others who are similarly passionate. In the end, this means being an eternal student.</p>
